#Neural Network C++ Library
This Library should help by creating the first sort of KI and should help, geting started with neural networks,
furthermore it should be a light weight c++ library for simple KI implementations.

#Comming Soon
<ul>
<il>saving connections to file</il>
<il>loading inputs and outputs</il>
<il>creating a more advanced NN with the Network class (Neural Network)</il>
<ul>
<li>loopback neurons, in order to get a kind of memory</li>
<li>random or oszillating neurons, in order to get a better learning behaviour<li>
</ul>
<li>adding visualization (console)</li>
</ul>

#Main.cpp
A small example, which learns the NN a pattern 3x3, either 1 or 0 and associates a number with it.
