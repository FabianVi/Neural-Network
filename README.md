#Neural Network C++ Library
This Library should help by creating the first sort of KI and should help, geting started with neural networks,
furthermore it should be a light weight c++ library for simple KI implementations.

#Comming Soon
*adding new learning technics
  *currently weights get updated by a randome generator and over time the NN improves
  *future e.g. backpropergation etc. p. p.
 *ERROR Handling
*saving Weights (connections) to file
*loading inputs and outputs
*creating a more advanced NN with the Network class (Neural Network)
  *loopback neurons, in order to get a kind of memory
  *random or oszillating neurons, in order to get a better learning behaviour
*adding visualization
*multithreading

#Example
##Main.cpp
This File contains a test programm, which showes the curent progress of the project and the power of the Neural Network, 
furthermore it shoulde be a benchmark for the improvement over time.
It trys to learn Tic Tac Toe, by playing against it self.
